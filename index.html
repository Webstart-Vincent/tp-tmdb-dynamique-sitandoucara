            <p>
              More than two decades have passed since Sarah Connor prevented
              Judgment Day, changed the future, and re-wrote the fate of the
              human race. Dani Ramos is living a simple life in Mexico City with
              her brother and father when a highly advanced and deadly new
              Terminator – a Rev-9 – travels back through time to hunt and kill
              her. Dani's survival depends on her joining forces with two
              warriors: Grace, an enhanced super-soldier from the future, and a
              battle-hardened Sarah Connor. As the Rev-9 ruthlessly destroys
              everything and everyone in its path on the hunt for Dani, the
              three are led to a T-800 from Sarah’s past that may be their last
              best hope.

            <p>
              Simba idolises his father, King Mufasa, and takes to heart his own
              royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new
              cub's arrival. Scar, Mufasa's brother—and former heir to the
              throne—has plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is ravaged
              with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba's
              exile. With help from a curious pair of newfound friends, Simba
              will have to figure out how to grow up and take back what is
              rightfully his.

            <p>
              Ever since US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs and lawless
              outcast Shaw first faced off, they just have swapped smacks and
              bad words. But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton's
              ruthless actions threaten the future of humanity, both join forces
              to defeat him. (A spin-off of “The Fate of the Furious,” focusing
              on Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Statham's Deckard Shaw.)
